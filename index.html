    <p class="container_2"> As of September 15, 2023, New Yorkers now have access to the new Monovalent Covid-19 vaccine. It has been realsed just as New York is moving through cold and flu season and into winter months, which is when the CDC warns hospitalizations tend to increase. The new vaccine aims to curb serious illness and hospitalization rates from new variants of the Covid-19 virus. With new vaccines, comes new regulations, see below for vaccine recommendations and accessibility.

            <p class="container"> <b> What’s different about this new vaccine? </b> </p>

            <p  class="container"> This is not a booster shot. A booster shot uses the immunity that has already been received from a previous vaccine. This newly released vaccine targets a relatively new strain, XBB.1.5, a subvariant of Omicron. Omnicron produced an uptick in covid cases due to its high virality rate. This new vaccine hopes to also support immunity against newly introduced strains of the virus like FL 1.51 and EG.5.</p>

<div>
    <p class="container"> <b> What are the regulations? </b> </p>
    <p class="container"> Unlike previous Covid-19 vaccine regulations, the most recent vaccine is recommended to everyone 6 months or older. The FDA released regulations following the updated vaccine: Regardless of previous vaccination, people 5 years of age or older are eligible to receive a single dose at least two months after the last dose of any Covid-19 vaccine. Individuals within the 6 month to 4 year age range who are vaccinated, are eligible to receive one or two doses of the newly updated vaccine. Unvaccinated individuals that are between the 6 months to 4 year age range are eligible for either three doses of the Pfizer-BioTech Covid-19 Vaccine or two doses of the updated monovalent Covid-19 vaccine. The CDC released, it is safe to receive the annual flu shot and the updated vaccine at the same time.

    <p class="container"> <b> How to get the shot? </b> </p>
<p class="container"> The new vaccine is free! Whether you have insurance or are not insured, the vaccine is available. It is covered by private insurance plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. If you do not have insurance, the CDC has programs like the Bridge Program and the Vaccine for Children Program that allow uninsured patients to have access at no cost. Where to get the vaccine: In New York City, the primary suppliers of the new vaccine, in partnership with the federal government, are CVS and Walgreens pharmacies. </p>

    <p class="container"> <b> How is New York handling the Covid-19 virus now? </b> </p>
<p class="container"> According to NYC Health, as of this fall, New York City has a daily average of 779 Covid-19 cases, 24 hospitalizations related to Covid-19 per day, and an average fatality rate of 3 people per day. NYCHealth tracks long-term data trends, and Covid-19 tends to spike around the beginning of each year, with 2022 being the worst spike since the beginning of the pandemic. These spikes correlate to the spread of new strains of the virus. The movement to create an updated vaccine for this fall is a preventative measure, attempting  to curb the potential for a larger covid-19 case spike caused by new variants like 2022. Getting vaccinated is still important!</p>
